# hello-world
Just Twinkering 
I just thought about submitting my first commit ever, so here I am.
Just in case you are all wondering, I am also deeply interested in Python & Java.
I had plans set to start knowing in depth about them but I haven't been able to yet. But all aside, I will someday.
Have a great day everyone!
